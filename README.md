**Installing python**

The majority of the people in the McMorran group are currently using python 2.7, this is for a number of reasons but mostly because many of the scientific tools and libraries have not been updated to python 3.
This reason is becoming increasingly less true and we may want to switch to python 3 in the nearish future.
Our group generally uses the anaconda distribution of python.
To install just visit the page at the link and follow the directions.
It comes with many of the additional packages that are needed to do scientific programing and can help you get off the ground and started more quickly.
If you donâ€™t like this batteries included approach feel free to download python and install individual packages as you need them.

**Learning python**

There are two major parts of learning how to use python for scientific projects.
First, learning the syntax (how to perform a loop, read/write files etc.) and second learning how to convert equations and scientifc modles into that syntax.
I found that the best way for me to learn the language (syntax) was to use it.
The best resource I have found to guide me through that process is Learn Python the Hard Way.
Working through all the exercises until you get to exercise 44, should cover the majority of the syntax and programing basics that you need to start working on a scientific project.
If you get bored of learning python the hard way you can look at code academy it is a little different format, but still a good way to learn python, syntax.
There are a number of good resources for learning how to use python for scientific programing instead of trying to list them here I have opted to incoperate links into the jupyter notebooks in places that they are relevant.
This is meant to put things in context, but the reader should know that a huge part of being a sucessful programer is having the ability to quickly find answeres to a coding problem.
Often someone else has already asked the same question or part of the same question and all you need to do is find that information on google usually on a stack exchange post.
